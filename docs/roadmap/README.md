# Tracks Framework Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development phases for the Tracks framework. It is designed to be **flexible and adjustable** as we learn during implementation. Each phase builds on the previous ones, but the specifics can be revised based on discoveries and changing priorities.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17
**Roadmap Version:** 1.0.0

- **In Progress** - Active development
- **Complete** - Feature implemented and tested
- **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
- **Revised** - Plan changed based on learnings

## Dependencies

### Critical Path

```text
Foundation → Core Web → Data Layer → Auth System → Generation
                            ↓
                     Production Ready
                            ↓
                    Advanced Features
```

### Feature Dependencies

- **Auth System** requires: Data Layer (for user tables), Core Web (for sessions)
- **Code Generation** requires: Data Layer (SQLC), Templates (templ)
- **RBAC** requires: Authentication (users must exist)
- **MCP Server** requires: Most other features to be implemented
- **Background Jobs** requires: Services to queue jobs

## Adjustments & Revisions

### Version History

| Version | Date | Changes | Reason |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 1.0.0 | 2025-10-17 | Initial roadmap | Project inception |

### Planned Review Points

- After each phase completion
- When blockers are encountered
- Monthly progress review

## Notes

- Documentation and example apps evolve continuously with each feature
- Docusaurus versions will align with minor releases (0.5, 0.7, 1.0)
- Each feature includes its documentation as part of "done"
- This roadmap is a living document - see [ADJUSTING.md](./ADJUSTING.md) for update guidelines

## Success Metrics

Each phase has specific success criteria defined in its detailed documentation. Generally:

1. **Phase Success** = All features implemented, tested, and documented
2. **Feature Success** = Works as specified in PRD, has tests, has documentation
3. **Overall Success** = Developers can build production apps with Tracks

## Next Steps

1. Review [Phase 0: Foundation](./phases/0-foundation.md) details
2. Set up development environment per [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. Begin implementation of Phase 0 features
