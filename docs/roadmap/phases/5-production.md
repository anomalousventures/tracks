# Phase 5: Production

[← Back to Roadmap](../README.md) | [← Phase 4](./4-generation.md) | [Phase 6 →](./6-advanced.md)

## Overview

This phase focuses on production readiness with observability, comprehensive testing, security hardening, and deployment configurations. The goal is to ensure applications built with Tracks are production-ready.

**Target Version:** v0.8.0
**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 weeks
**Status:** Not Started

## Goals

- OpenTelemetry observability
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Security headers and CSP
- External service adapters
- Deployment configurations

## Features

### 5.1 OpenTelemetry

**Description:** Full observability with tracing, metrics, and logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Trace propagation
- [ ] Metric collection
- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Exporter configuration
- [ ] Performance monitoring

**PRD Reference:** [Observability](../../prd/12_observability.md)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use OTLP exporters
- Configure sampling
- Add custom spans
- Include database tracing

### 5.2 Testing Framework

**Description:** Comprehensive testing utilities and patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Test helpers and utilities
- [ ] Mock generation
- [ ] Integration test framework
- [ ] E2E test support
- [ ] Coverage reporting

**PRD Reference:** [Testing](../../prd/13_testing.md)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Table-driven tests
- Testcontainers for integration
- Mock interfaces automatically
- Parallel test execution

### 5.3 Security Headers

**Description:** Security hardening with proper headers

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] CSP with nonces
- [ ] HSTS configuration
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CORS handling
- [ ] Rate limiting

**PRD Reference:** [Security](../../prd/6_security.md)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Configurable CSP policies
- Nonce generation for scripts
- Security middleware ordering
- Regular security audits

### 5.4 Service Adapters

**Description:** External service integrations

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Email service adapters
- [ ] SMS service adapters
- [ ] Payment providers
- [ ] Storage adapters
- [ ] Adapter interface patterns

**PRD Reference:** [External Services](../../prd/8_external_services.md)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Interface-based design
- Multiple provider support
- Graceful degradation
- Mock adapters for testing

### 5.5 Deployment Configs

**Description:** Production deployment configurations

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Docker support
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Health checks
- [ ] Graceful shutdown

**PRD Reference:** [Deployment](../../prd/17_deployment.md)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Multi-stage Dockerfiles
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Rolling updates
- Zero-downtime deployments

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Phases 0-4 completed
- Core functionality stable

### External Dependencies

- OpenTelemetry libraries
- Testing frameworks
- Security libraries
- Cloud provider SDKs

### Internal Dependencies

- All core features implemented
- Stable API surface

## Success Criteria

1. Full observability in production
2. >80% test coverage achievable
3. Security headers pass audits
4. External services integrated smoothly
5. Deployable to major cloud providers

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance overhead | Medium | Careful instrumentation |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Regular audits |
| Deployment complexity | Medium | Good documentation |

## Testing Requirements

- Load testing
- Security testing
- Integration testing
- Deployment testing
- Observability validation

## Documentation Requirements

- Production deployment guide
- Observability setup
- Security configuration
- Testing best practices
- Service adapter docs

## Future Considerations

Features that depend on this phase:

- Advanced monitoring features
- Performance optimization
- Scaling strategies

## Adjustments Log

This section tracks changes made to the original plan.

| Date | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| - | - | No changes yet |

## Notes

- Production readiness is critical for adoption
- Don't compromise on security
- Observability should be built-in, not bolted-on
- Keep deployment simple initially
