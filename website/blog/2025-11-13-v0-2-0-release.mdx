I'm excited to announce **Tracks v0.2.0**, marking the completion of Phase 0 (Foundation). The CLI tool can now generate production-ready Go web applications with clean architecture, comprehensive tooling, and multi-database support.

:::info What's in v0.2.0

**Status:** Phase 0 - Foundation ✅ Complete

**Available Now:**
- ✅ Complete `tracks new` command with project scaffolding
- ✅ Multi-database driver support (LibSQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Development tooling (Makefile, Air, Docker Compose, golangci-lint, Mockery, CI/CD)
- ✅ Auto-generated `.env` and automatic Docker service startup
- ✅ Production-ready templates with health endpoints, logging, and configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with tutorials and guides

**Try It:**
```bash
# Install (requires Go 1.25+)
go install github.com/anomalousventures/tracks/cmd/tracks@v0.2.0

# Create a new project
tracks new myapp
cd myapp

# Start development (auto-starts Docker, runs with live reload)
make dev
```

## Phase 0: Mission Accomplished

Phase 0 (Foundation) set out to build the CLI infrastructure and project generation capabilities that would serve as the foundation for all future features. With v0.2.0, all five epics are complete:

1. ✅ **CLI Infrastructure** - Cobra framework, Renderer pattern, mode detection
2. ✅ **Template Engine** - Embedded template system with variable substitution
3. ✅ **Project Generation** - Complete `tracks new` command
4. ✅ **Generated Project Tooling** - Makefile, Docker, CI/CD, testing, linting
5. ✅ **Documentation** - Installation guides, tutorials, architecture docs, CLI reference

This milestone means Tracks can now generate real, working Go applications that you can run, test, and deploy today.

## What's Working

### Project Generation (`tracks new`)

The star of this release is the `tracks new` command, which generates a complete Go web application with clean architecture and production-ready tooling.

</picture>

**What you get:**

```bash
tracks new myapp
# Choose database driver: LibSQL (default), SQLite3, or PostgreSQL
# Generates complete project structure with:
# - Clean layered architecture (handlers → services → repositories)
# - Health check endpoint with database connectivity test
# - Auto-generated .env with sensible defaults
# - Makefile with dev, test, lint, build targets
# - Docker Compose for local development
# - GitHub Actions CI workflow
# - All tests passing out of the box
```

You can customize the generated project with flags:

```bash
# Specify database driver
tracks new myapp --db postgres

# Provide custom module path
tracks new myapp --module github.com/myorg/myapp

# Skip git initialization
tracks new myapp --no-git
```

See the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli/new) for all available options.

### Development Tooling

Generated projects include a comprehensive development environment that just works:

**Makefile targets:**
```bash
make dev       # Auto-starts Docker services, runs with Air live reload
make test      # Runs all tests
make lint      # Runs golangci-lint for code quality
make build     # Builds production binary
make generate  # Generates test mocks and SQL code
```

**Docker Compose integration:**
- Automatic service startup with `make dev`
- Database containers for all supported drivers (Postgres, LibSQL, SQLite)
- Health checks and proper networking
- No manual configuration required

**Live reload with Air:**
- Watches for code changes
- Automatically rebuilds and restarts
- Fast feedback loop during development

**CI/CD ready:**
- GitHub Actions workflow included
- Tests run on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- Linting enforced in CI
- Mock generation verified

### Production-Ready Architecture

Generated applications follow clean architecture principles and include everything you need for production:

**Health check endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# Returns JSON with status and timestamp
```

**Structured logging:**
- zerolog for high-performance JSON logging
- Configurable log levels via environment variables
- Request logging middleware included

**Configuration management:**
- Hierarchical config (defaults → .env → env vars)
- Type-safe configuration with Viper
- Environment-specific settings

**Type-safe database queries:**
- SQLC integration generates Go code from SQL
- Compile-time query validation
- Support for LibSQL, SQLite3, and PostgreSQL

## Documentation

This release includes comprehensive documentation to help you get started:

- **[Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation)** - Installation and setup
- **[Quickstart Tutorial](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)** - Create your first project in 15 minutes
- **[CLI Reference](/docs/cli/new)** - Complete command documentation
- **[Architecture Overview](/docs/guides/architecture-overview)** - Understand the generated project structure

All documentation is available at [go-tracks.io](https://go-tracks.io/).

## What's Next

With Phase 0 complete, development moves to **Phase 1 (Core Web Layer)**:

- **Code generators** for resources, handlers, services, and repositories
- **Interactive TUI** for guided project setup with Bubble Tea
- **Additional scaffolding commands** for common patterns

See the [full roadmap](https://go-tracks.io/roadmap) for details on all planned phases.
