The day after Thanksgiving seems like the perfect time to share what we've been cooking up. **Tracks v0.3.0** marks the completion of Phase 1 (Core Web Layer), and we're grateful for the progress. Generated applications now include a complete web stack with Chi router, templ templates, HTMX v2, TemplUI components, and a production-ready middleware stack.

:::info What's in v0.3.0

**Status:** Phase 1 - Core Web Layer ✅ Complete

**New in This Release:**

- ✅ Air live reload for .templ, .css, and .js files
- ✅ Working counter example demonstrating HTMX patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for all features

**Try It:**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install anomalousventures/tap/tracks

# Or with Go 1.25+

## Phase 1: Core Web Layer Complete

Phase 1 builds on the foundation from v0.2.0, adding everything needed for a complete web application. All five epics are now finished:

1. ✅ **Chi Router Setup** - Route registration, middleware chains, graceful shutdown
2. ✅ **Templ Templates** - Type-safe HTML with layouts, pages, and components
3. ✅ **Asset Pipeline** - TailwindCSS v4, HTMX v2, hashfs content-addressed URLs
4. ✅ **TemplUI Integration** - 100+ components with `tracks ui` CLI commands
5. ✅ **Middleware & Documentation** - Security headers, CSP, CORS, comprehensive guides

Generated projects now have a complete, production-ready web layer out of the box.

## Production-Ready Middleware Stack

Every generated application includes a carefully ordered middleware stack with 10 middleware components:

| Middleware | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| RequestID | Unique ID for each request (tracing) |
| RealIP | Extract client IP from proxy headers |
| Compress | Gzip response compression |
| Logger | Structured request logging |
| Recoverer | Panic recovery with stack traces |
| Timeout | Cancel long-running requests |
| Throttle | Limit concurrent requests |
| CSP | Content-Security-Policy with nonces |
| SecurityHeaders | X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc. |
| CORS | Cross-origin requests (disabled by default) |

All configurable via environment variables:

```bash
# Timeout: cancel requests after 60 seconds
APP_MIDDLEWARE_TIMEOUT_REQUEST=60s

# Throttle: max 100 concurrent requests, 50 in backlog
APP_MIDDLEWARE_THROTTLE_LIMIT=100
APP_MIDDLEWARE_THROTTLE_BACKLOG_LIMIT=50

# CORS: enable for specific origins
APP_MIDDLEWARE_CORS_ENABLED=true
APP_MIDDLEWARE_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com
```

See the [Middleware Guide](/docs/guides/middleware) for complete documentation.

## TemplUI Component Integration

Generated projects now include [TemplUI](https://templui.io), a component library inspired by shadcn/ui but built for Go's templ templating system. Over 100 components are available:

```bash
# Add components to your project
tracks ui add button card toast alert

# List available components
tracks ui list

# Upgrade templUI version
tracks ui upgrade
```

Components are copied into your project at `internal/http/views/components/ui/`, giving you full ownership to customize as needed.

**Example usage in templ:**

```templ
package pages

import "myapp/internal/http/views/components/ui"

templ HomePage() {
    <div class="container mx-auto p-4">
        @ui.Card(ui.CardProps{}) {
            @ui.CardHeader() {
                @ui.CardTitle() {
                    Welcome to My App
                }
            }
            @ui.CardContent() {
                <p>Built with Tracks and TemplUI</p>
            }
            @ui.CardFooter() {
                @ui.Button(ui.ButtonProps{}) {
                    Get Started
                }
            }
        }
    </div>
}
```

## Complete Asset Pipeline

The asset pipeline handles everything from development to production:

**TailwindCSS v4:**
- Automatic compilation on file changes
- Minified output for production
- Custom configuration support

**HTMX v2 with Extensions:**
- head-support for `<head>` element updates
- idiomorph for smooth DOM morphing
- response-targets for flexible response handling

**Content-Addressed URLs (hashfs):**
- URLs include content hash: `app.abc123.css`
- 1-year immutable cache headers
- ETag support with 304 Not Modified responses
- Gzip compression for text assets

**Air Live Reload:**
- Watches `.templ`, `.css`, `.js` files
- Automatic rebuild and browser refresh
- Fast feedback loop during development

## Working HTMX Example

Every generated project includes a counter component demonstrating HTMX patterns:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '2rem 0'}}>
  <img src="/img/counter-demo.gif" alt="HTMX Counter Demo - clicking increment and decrement buttons updates the counter without page reloads" style={{maxWidth: '400px', borderRadius: '8px', boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'}} />
</div>

```templ
// Counter component with HTMX
templ Counter(count int) {
    <div id="counter" class="flex items-center gap-4">
        <button
            hx-post="/counter/decrement"
            hx-target="#counter"
            hx-swap="outerHTML"
            class="btn">
            -
        </button>
        <span class="text-2xl font-bold">{ strconv.Itoa(count) }</span>
        <button
            hx-post="/counter/increment"
            hx-target="#counter"
            hx-swap="outerHTML"
            class="btn">
            +
        </button>
    </div>
}
```

The counter updates without page reloads, showing how HTMX enables interactivity while keeping your application server-rendered.

## Security by Default

Generated applications are secure out of the box:

**Content-Security-Policy with Nonces:**
```go
// Nonces are generated per-request and available in templates
<script nonce={ templ.GetNonce(ctx) }>
    // Inline scripts allowed with correct nonce
</script>
```

**Security Headers:**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` - Disables unused browser features

**CORS Disabled by Default:**
For same-origin HTMX applications, CORS is unnecessary and disabled. Enable it only when needed for cross-origin API access.
