            **Context: Go 1.24+ Modern Practices**
            This project uses Go 1.25.5 with modern tooling patterns:
            - The `tool` directive in go.mod (introduced in Go 1.24) declares development tools
            - Tools are invoked with `go tool <name>` (e.g., `go tool golangci-lint`)
            - This is the modern approach and replaces the legacy tools.go pattern
            - All make commands should use `go tool` prefix for tools declared in the tool block
            - Go 1.25.5 is the current stable version (not a typo)

            **For Go Code Files:**

            **BLOCKERS (must be fixed):**
            - Comments that don't explain WHY (comments should only ever explain _why_ and never _what_ - the code should be self-documenting)
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Tests that test implementation details instead of behavior

            **Code Quality:**
            - Go idioms and best practices
            - Error handling patterns
            - Security considerations

            **Testing Guidelines:**
            - Tests should verify application behavior, not implementation details
            - Tests should be readable and maintainable
            - Tests should use descriptive names that explain the scenario being tested
            - Avoid testing internal functions directly - test through public interfaces
            - Mock external dependencies, not internal code

            **Comments Policy:**
            - Flag ANY comment that explains WHAT the code does as a BLOCKER
            - Comments should only explain WHY decisions were made
            - Prefer descriptive variable/function names over explanatory comments
            - Code should be self-documenting through clear naming

            **For Documentation Files (.md, .mdx):**

            **Documentation Quality:**
            - Clarity and completeness of instructions
            - Accuracy of code examples
            - Consistency with project architecture and conventions
            - Security considerations are properly documented
            - Step-by-step instructions are logical and complete
            - Verification procedures are adequate
            - Links and references are correct
            - For .mdx files: JSX syntax is correct and imports are valid

            The CI pipeline will run tests, linting, and security scanning automatically.
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
