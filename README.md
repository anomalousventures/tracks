## Current Status

Tracks is in **Phase 0 (Foundation)** development. The CLI tool and project scaffolding are being built.

**What works now:**

- âœ… Project structure and monorepo setup
- âœ… Documentation and roadmap
- ðŸš§ CLI infrastructure (in progress)

**Coming next:**

- Phase 0: CLI tool with `tracks new` command
- Phase 1: Core web layer (routing, handlers, middleware)
- Phase 2: Database layer (SQLC, migrations)
- See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for details

## Vision

Tracks will be a code-generating web framework for Go that produces idiomatic, production-ready applications. Built for developers who want the productivity of modern frameworks with the performance and simplicity of Go.

### Design Principles

#### Type-Safe Everything

- [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) for compile-time HTML safety
- [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/) generates type-safe Go from SQL
- No runtime reflection in generated code

#### Hypermedia-First

- HTMX integration for dynamic UIs without JavaScript
- Server-rendered templates with progressive enhancement
- RESTful patterns with HTML as the engine of application state

#### Idiomatic Go

- Generated code looks hand-written by an experienced Go developer
- Standard library patterns and clear error handling
- Dependency injection via interfaces for easy testing

#### Batteries Included

- Authentication (magic links, OTP, OAuth)
- Authorization (Casbin RBAC)
- Observability (OpenTelemetry)
- Development tooling (hot reload, linting, CI/CD templates)

## Roadmap

Tracks development is organized into 7 phases. See [`docs/roadmap`](./docs/roadmap) for detailed plans.

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current)

**Goal:** Working CLI that generates project scaffolds

**Epics:**

1. [CLI Infrastructure](./docs/roadmap/phases/0-foundation/epics/1-cli-infrastructure.md) - Cobra framework, Renderer pattern, version tracking
2. [Template Engine](./docs/roadmap/phases/0-foundation/epics/2-template-engine.md) - Embed system for project templates
3. [Project Generation](./docs/roadmap/phases/0-foundation/epics/3-project-generation.md) - `tracks new` command
4. [Generated Project Tooling](./docs/roadmap/phases/0-foundation/epics/4-generated-tooling.md) - Makefiles, Air, linting, Docker, CI/CD
5. [Documentation](./docs/roadmap/phases/0-foundation/epics/5-documentation.md) - Installation guides, getting started

**Status:** In progress Â· **Target:** v0.1.0

### Future Phases

- **Phase 1:** Core Web Layer - Chi router, handlers, middleware, templ templates
- **Phase 2:** Database Layer - SQLC, Goose migrations, LibSQL/PostgreSQL support
- **Phase 3:** Authentication - Magic links, OTP, OAuth providers
- **Phase 4:** Interactive TUI - Bubble Tea interface for generators
- **Phase 5:** Production - OpenTelemetry, health checks, deployment
- **Phase 6:** Authorization - Casbin RBAC
- **Phase 7:** Advanced Features - Real-time, file uploads, background jobs

## Philosophy

### Idiomatic Go

Tracks generates code that looks like it was hand-written by an experienced Go developer:

- No magic or reflection in generated code
- Standard library patterns and interfaces
- Explicit error handling with context
- Interface-based design for testability

### Type Safety

Type safety catches errors at compile time:

- templ templates are type-checked Go code
- SQLC generates Go structs and functions from SQL
- No string-based query building or SQL injection risks
- DTOs with field-level validation

### Hypermedia-First

HTMX enables rich interactions without JavaScript complexity:

- Server renders HTML with templ templates
- HTMX provides dynamic UI updates via HTML over the wire
- Progressive enhancement with Alpine.js where needed
- Standard HTTP and REST patterns

### Convention Over Configuration

Sensible defaults with escape hatches:

- Standard project structure and file organization
- Generators follow consistent patterns
- Override defaults when needed
- Configuration via environment variables and YAML

## Technology Stack

**Router:** Chi - lightweight, idiomatic HTTP router
**Templates:** templ - type-safe HTML templates compiled to Go
**Database:** SQLC - generates type-safe Go from SQL queries
**Migrations:** Goose - version-controlled database migrations
**Auth:** Custom + OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
**Authorization:** Casbin - role-based access control
**Frontend:** HTMX + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS (optional)
**Observability:** OpenTelemetry - tracing, metrics, and logs
**Logging:** zerolog - structured JSON logging
**Testing:** Standard library + testify for assertions
**CLI/TUI:** Cobra + Bubble Tea (Charm stack)

## Project Status

Tracks is in **pre-alpha development** (Phase 0). The API and generated code structure may change significantly before v1.0.

**Not ready for production use.** Follow development progress via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/anomalousventures/tracks/issues) and [Roadmap](./docs/roadmap/README.md).
